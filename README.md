# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This Movie Recommendation System is designed to suggest movies to users based on their favourite movie. The system uses machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to recommend movies that are similar to the ones a user has previously liked. The recommendation system is built using **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** algorithms, specifically utilizing **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and **Cosine Similarity**.

### Key Features:
- Recommends movies based on a given favourite movie title.
- Utilizes movie descriptions to find content-based similarities.
- Handles fuzzy matching for movie titles using the **difflib** library.
- Built with Python, using popular machine learning and data science libraries.
